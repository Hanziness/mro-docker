# A Docker image for Microsoft R Open

Microsoft R Open, formerly known as Revolution R Open, is an "enhanced R distribution".
You can use this Docker container to give MRO a quick try, i.e. without any impact on your local system, or to run MRO in an online Docker infrastructure.

Homepage: https://mran.microsoft.com/open

For plain R Docker images see [Rocker](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker). The Rocker images were a great help in creating the MRO images.

> _MRO focusses on speed and reproducibility._

By default, packages are not installed from main CRAN, but from a CRAN repository snapshot.
For more information see https://mran.microsoft.com/documents/rro/reproducibility.
MRO promises better speed by using special multi-threaded math libraries, replacing default R's BLAS/LAPACK libraries.

**Important**: By running this container you accept the MKL and MRO licenses.

## Run container

```bash
docker run --user docker nuest/mro
```

This downloads the latest build of the image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nuest/mro/).
In the container, R is automatically started. When you exit R, the container is automatically stopped.

Optionally you can use [tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/nuest/mro/tags/) for specific versions of MRO and execute a demo script:

```bash
docker run -it --rm nuest/mro:3.5.3

# in R
> source("demo.R")
```

Alternatively, you can start regular bash (you can skip the `--user docker` if root rights are needed in the container):

```bash
docker run -it --user docker mro /bin/bash
```

To work with your own data, simply mount a directory on the host computer to the container, see the [Docker documentation on volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/containers/dockervolumes/).

You can install packages etc. in the R session as usual, though for reproducibility it is strongly recommended to do this _only_ in the Dockerfile.

## 3.5.3

> _Microsoft R Open 3.5.3 is based on R-3.5.3._
> _The default CRAN mirror has been updated to point to the fixed CRAN repository snapshot from Apr 15, 2019._ [release notes](https://mran.microsoft.com/news#mro353)

The base image is Ubuntu 18.04.
This is also the first MRO image with `Rcpp` preinstalled.
See also [MRO 3.5.3 documentation](https://mran.microsoft.com/releases/3.5.3).

```bash
cd 3.5.3
docker build -t mro:3.5.3 .
```

### 3.5.3-verse

A copycat of the `rocker/verse` image, installing `tidyverse` and other often used packages, and adding R Markdown authoring tools (LaTeX etc.).

```bash
# if using only local builds:
#docker tag mro:3.5.3 nuest/mro:3.5.3

cd 3.5.3-verse
docker build -t mro:3.5.3-verse .
```

## 3.5.0

> _Microsoft R Open 3.5.0 is based on R-3.5.0._
> _The default CRAN mirror has been updated to point to the fixed CRAN repository snapshot from June 01, 2018._ [release notes](https://mran.microsoft.com/news#mro350)

The base image is Ubuntu 16.04.
See also [MRO 3.5.0 documentation](https://mran.microsoft.com/releases/3.5.0).

```bash
cd 3.5.0
docker build -t mro:3.5.0 .
```

## 3.4.4

> _The CRAN repository points to a snapshot from May 1, 2017._
> _This means that every user of Microsoft R Open has access to the same set of CRAN package versions._ [source](https://mran.microsoft.com/documents/rro/installation/#revorinst-lin)

The base image is Ubuntu 16.04.
See also [MRO 3.4.4 documentation](https://mran.microsoft.com/releases/3.4.4).

Build the image:

```bash
cd 3.4.4
docker build -t mro:3.4.4 .
```

## 3.2.5

See installation instructions: https://mran.microsoft.com/archives/install-doc/mro-3.2.5/
The base image is Ubuntu 14.04.
The interactive installation script of the MKL download package was adapted in the file `RevoMath_noninteractive-install.sh` to not require any user input.
See also [MRO 3.2.5 documentation](https://mran.microsoft.com/archives/mro-3.2.5) (archived).

Build the image:

```bash
cd 3.2.5
docker build -t mro:3.2.5 .
```

## Automatic builds

The automatic builds are configured to run on the `master` branch and each Dockerfile, e.g. `/3.4.0/Dockerfile` is tagged with the full release version, e.g. `3.4.0`. Other semantic version tags are added automatically by build hooks based on the directory names, e.g. `latest`, `3`, and `3.4` for our example.
